				<b>Kuchen</b> (German pronunciation: [ˈkuːxən] (About this sound listen)), the German word for 
				cake, is used in other languages as the name for several different types of savory or sweet
				desserts, pastries, and gateaux. Most Kuchen have eggs and flour as common ingredients while 
				also, but not always, including some form of sweetener and/or fat. In Germany it is a common
				tradition to invite friends over to one's house or to a cafe between 
				noon and evening to drink coffee and eat Kuchen.
				<br></br>
				The term itself may cover as many distinct desserts as its English counterpart "cake".
				However, the word "cake" covers both Kuchen and Torte, sometimes confused with one another. 
				The key difference being that a Torte is a Kuchen that is decorated or layered with cream, 
				frosting, ganache, or fruit based filling after baking. A Kuchen is typically less decorative
				or fancy in nature. Examples of a Torte made from a base Kuchen include
				the Jewish Palacsinken Torte[3] and Mohn Torte (or Kindli).
